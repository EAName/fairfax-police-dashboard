## Basic Usage
Here are some tips for navigating and using this dashboard:
- Hover over question marks (?) to see specific help, definitions, and explanations for charts, filters, and other widgets.
- Filters can be applied using the menus on the sidebar on the left. If the Filters sidebar is closed, click the ">" in the upper left corner to expand the sidebar.
- Hovering over charts will show a box containing the values plotted at the mouse location.

## Troubleshooting
Currently, there is only one known issue. 

Certain combinations of filters can result in no data being available to plot (i.e. no stops match the filters). When this occurs, no data will be shown for the appropriate cases. Following this, the charts may stop updating. The dashboard can be reset by re-loading.

## Report Issues

If possible when reporting an issue, please describe what steps to take in order to re-create the issue, including what the values are in each of the filters.
